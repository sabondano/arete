LinkedIn is the world’s largest professional network with over 238 million users, 27% of which are tapped into the community while on the go, accessing the network from their mobile devices. It’s the social media outlet standing truest to the term “networking.” Skilled professionals from all areas of expertise log into LinkedIn to make connections with other professionals about business. This means there is no “social clutter,” no wild tweenagers, whining ex-girlfriends or over-achieving soccer moms. It’s straight business all the time. It’s a great way to meet other professionals with similar goals or businesses. It’s a also a great job search or recruiting platform. And, of course, it’s a great place for your business and your products to be showcased. 

1. LinkedIn assigns a level of connection between yourself and any other user similar to the theory of six degrees of separation. If you have actually requested to connect with someone and they’ve accepted you (or vice versa) you will be his or her “1st Connection.” Then, automatically, you become a “2nd connection” to all his or her “1st Connections,”and so on. This categorization allows you to almost always find a connection who can introduce you to the person you are looking to develop a relationship with. LinkedIn created this notion to help facilitate your ability to make more connections. Take advantage of it. 

2. InMail. It’s like email, but for LinkedIn. Once you are directly connected to someone on LinkedIn, you will now have the ability to direct message them through the network using InMail. It’s just another simple communication tool, but since its housed in LinkedIn it inherently takes on an immediately professional tone, again aiding in your end goal of entering into meaningful business conversation. 

3. Create a business page. Make sure your business has a presence in LinkedIn. Include a brief background and simple “about us” in the information section. This can even help with your SEO ranking. LinkedIn now offers some unique capabilities to highlight a business’s products and offerings. Leverage that space to create a virtual portfolio of your work for all to see. 

4. Building a powerful team to represent your company can be very challenging, but at the end of the day, that team makes you who you are. Make sure all of your current superstars are on LinkedIn and listed as employees of your company. Write recommendations about them highlighting their strengths to your clients. And be sure to recruit through LinkedIn. Each person’s profile is basically a virtual resume- use it to search for qualified individuals who could join your team. LinkedIn even offers the ability to post any current job listings through their service. 

5. LinkedIn’s advertising engine works much like Facebook’s in that you can target users based on information they’ve disclosed while setting up their profile and their current IP address. For example, you can write a specific text ad to be served to men in New York with the title “Vice President.” Once your campaign is running you can also monitor the success of your ad through LinkedIn’s analytics and make appropriate updates to increase its performance.
